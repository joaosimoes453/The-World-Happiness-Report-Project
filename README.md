# Happiness Score Analysis - Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Data Analytics project on Happiness Score Analysis! In this project, I aimed to analyze the factors influencing the happiness scores of different countries over the years. I collected data from the World Happiness Report from 2015 to 2023 and performed various analyses and visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.

### Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Collection**: Collected data from the World Happiness Report spanning from 2015 to 2023.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of happiness scores and the relationships between different factors.

4. **Temporal Trends Analysis**: Analyzed how happiness scores have changed over the years using line plots and time series analysis.

5. **Regional Comparison**: Compared happiness scores across different regions using box plots and visualizations.

6. **Correlation Analysis**: Examined correlations between various factors and happiness scores.

7. **Statistical Modeling**: Built linear regression models to predict happiness scores based on selected factors.

8. **Machine Learning**: Explored machine learning techniques to predict happiness scores and evaluate model performance.

9. **Tableau Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations using Tableau Public to showcase the project's findings.

### Repository Structure

- `CSVs/`: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks with the data analysis and modeling steps and Visualization outputs generated during the analysis.
- `Tableau_Presentation/`: Explore the interactive visualizations and insights from the project through the [Tableau Public Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yourusername/viz/HappinessScoreAnalysis-DAP/FrontPage).


### Conclusion

Through thorough analysis and visualization, this project has provided insights into the factors contributing to happiness scores among different countries and regions. The interactive Tableau presentation allows for a deeper exploration of the findings. Feel free to explore the code, notebooks, and visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project.
